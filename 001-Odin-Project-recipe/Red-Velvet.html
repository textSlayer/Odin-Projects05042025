<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Red velvet cake is a visually striking dessert known for its rich red hue and soft, tender crumb. Unlike a standard chocolate cake, red velvet contains a small amount of cocoa powder, giving it a subtle chocolate flavor without overpowering sweetness. Its signature color traditionally came from a chemical reaction between natural cocoa and acidic ingredients, though modern recipes often enhance the red with food coloring.</p>
<p>The texture of red velvet is where it truly shines—it’s moist, light, and velvety, thanks to the use of buttermilk and vinegar. These acidic components react with baking soda to create a fluffy rise and distinctive crumb. This combination makes every bite smooth and melt-in-your-mouth, setting it apart from denser cakes.</p>
<p>Red velvet is almost always paired with a creamy, tangy cream cheese frosting, which perfectly balances the cake’s mild cocoa flavor and rich sweetness. It's a popular choice for celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, and its luxurious appearance and taste have made it a timeless classic in the world of desserts.</p>
