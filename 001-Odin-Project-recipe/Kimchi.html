<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kimchi is one of the most iconic dishes in Korean cuisine, deeply rooted in tradition and culture. It is typically made by fermenting napa cabbage or Korean radish with a flavorful mixture of chili powder, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. This fermentation process not only preserves the vegetables but also enhances their flavor, resulting in a complex, tangy, and spicy profile that evolves over time.</p>
<p>The preparation of kimchi is often a communal activity, especially during “Kimjang,” the traditional season when families gather to make large batches that last through the winter. Kimchi is more than just food—it’s a symbol of Korean identity and hospitality. There are hundreds of regional and seasonal varieties, each with its own unique twist depending on ingredients and climate.

</p>
<p>Nutritionally, kimchi is a powerhouse. It's packed with vitamins A, B, and C, and most importantly, it’s loaded with probiotics due to the fermentation process. These probiotics promote gut health, improve digestion, and support the immune system. Whether eaten as a side dish, cooked into stews, or added to fried rice, kimchi brings bold flavor and health benefits to every bite.</p>

    <li>1 tablespoon grated garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Korean red chili flakes (gochugaru)</li>

<hr><h2><strong>STEPS</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the napa cabbage into quarters and remove the core, then chop into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Place the cabbage in a large bowl, sprinkle with sea salt, and pour in water. Let it sit for 1–2 hours, tossing occasionally.</li>
    <li>Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold water 2–3 times to remove excess salt, then drain well.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together garlic, ginger, sugar, gochugaru, and fish sauce to create the kimchi paste.</li>
    <li>Add chopped green onions, radish, and carrots (if using) to the paste and mix well.</li>
    <li>Combine the paste mixture with the drained cabbage, using gloves to massage everything together until fully coated.</li>
    <li>Pack the kimchi tightly into a clean glass jar or container, pressing down to remove air bubbles.</li>
    <li>Leave some space at the top, seal the jar, and let it ferment at room temperature for 1–2 days.</li>
    <li>After fermenting, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator. It will continue to ferment slowly and develop flavor over time.</li>
